              <h3>Princeton University Sefer Hasidim Database (PUSHD)</h3>
              <p> Princeton University Sefer Hasidim Database (PUSHD), comprises seventeen late medieval Hebrew manuscripts of the Sefer Hasidim (Book of Pious) – the main sources for the study of Jews and Judaism in medieval Europe. <br> Although tradition attributes the authorship of Sefer Hasidim to a single author, Judah the Pious (d. 1217), it is clear from the extant manuscript evidence that the 
              book is the product of multiple creative endeavors. The manuscripts preserve different forms of the text, which vary widely in shape and scope, and contain passages which find no counterpart in any of the book’s modern versions. It was our principal goal, therefore, to build a database which would enable scholars to search, compare, and analyze different fragments of Sefer Hasidim, and in addition to this, to create a fundament for its prospective critical or synoptic edition.

              <h3>Toledot Yeshu Project (“Life-story of Jesus”)</h3>
              <p> The second project at Princeton, Toledot Yeshu (“Life-story of Jesus”), was published in 2014 as two volumes and a database at Mohr Siebeck, Tubingen. This critical edition publishes, translates, and analyzes one hundred and four manuscripts in Hebrew and Aramaic, the earliest of which date back to the sixth century CE. <br> The Book of the Life of Jesus (in Hebrew <i>Sefer Toledot Yeshu</i>) presents a chronicle of Jesus from a negative and anti-Christian perspective. It ascribes to Jesus an illegitimate birth, a theft of the Ineffable Name, heretic activities, and finally, a disgraceful death. Perhaps for centuries, the Toledot Yeshu circulated orally until it coalesced into various literary forms. Although the dates of these written compositions remain obscure, some early hints of a Jewish counter history of Jesus can be found in the works of Christian authors of Late Antiquity, such as Justin, Celsus, and Tertullian. Around 600 CE, some fragments of Jesus’ biography made their way into the Babylonian Talmud; and in 827, the archbishop Agobard of Lyon attests to a sacrilegious story of Jesus that circulated among Jews.

            <p>PhD, Classics</p>
            <p>PhD dissertation, Gifts after Death in Greek-Roman Egypt, presents a corpus of fifty-seven “divisions of property in contemplation of death,” a peculiar type of a bequest of property written on papyri and dating from the period between the first and seventh centuries CE. This work focuses on topics in family economy and on juristic and formulaic aspects of these documents and identifies their idiosyncratic significance as compared to other post-mortem transactions in late Roman and Byzantine Egypt, such as Hellenistic testaments. For this purpose, I analyze the types of bequeathed assets (money, movable and immovable property), the unilateral or contractual character of these documents, their provenance, and their chronological distribution. I presented my dissertation research in two articles (Helsinki and Ann Arbor Papyrology Proceedings) that draw a comparison between Egyptian divisions of property and Roman “gifts after death” (donationes mortis causa), based on Roman and Hellenistic regulations for the conveyance of ownership and possession.</p>
